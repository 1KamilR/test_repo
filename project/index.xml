      <description>Syed Kamil Riaz - skr973 Introduction The datatsets that I chose were NBA player tattoos and NBA &#39;draymond&#39;. The NBA player tattoo dataset describes whether a player in the NBA or who has been in the NBA has tattoos or does not have tattoos. It includes a categorical list of player names and whether they have tattoos or not. The common variable being player names, since most of the players overlap in the dataset is also in the NBA &#39;draymond&#39; dataset.</description>
