      <description>The Eyes of Texas Imagine everything that you do on campus is monetized, often without your consent, from social media posts to playing the sport you love. Now imagine walking to Darrell K. Royal Stadium on Saturdays past a fountain named after a man who fought to enslave your people. The same university that profits from you, doesn&#39;t even respect you. This is every Black student athlete&#39;s experience while walking past Littlefield Fountain, a monument named after a Confederate general who fought to keep slavery in America.</description>

      <description>Syed Kamil Riaz - skr973 Introduction The datatsets that I chose were NBA player tattoos and NBA &#39;draymond&#39;. The NBA player tattoo dataset describes whether a player in the NBA or who has been in the NBA has tattoos or does not have tattoos. It includes a categorical list of player names and whether they have tattoos or not. The common variable being player names, since most of the players overlap in the dataset is also in the NBA &#39;draymond&#39; dataset.</description>
