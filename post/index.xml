      <description>The Eyes of Texas Imagine everything that you do on campus is monetized, often without your consent, from social media posts to playing the sport you love. Now imagine walking to Darrell K. Royal Stadium on Saturdays past a fountain named after a man who fought to enslave your people. The same university that profits from you, doesn&#39;t even respect you. This is every Black student athlete&#39;s experience while walking past Littlefield Fountain, a monument named after a Confederate general who fought to keep slavery in America.</description>
